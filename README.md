# WindWizard

Being a Kitesurfer, I always have 5 diferent weather apps on my phone, What wind wizard does is collect weatherdata form multiple sources and allows the user to toogle between different forecasts.
This is an educational project, learning and improving understanding about working with apis is very important,
 so there may be shortcuts to a working page that will be overlooked in the intrest of understanding and practicing.
The goal of this project then, is to build a site that looks good and allows the user to check out weatherdata from multiple sources on one page.
The data will be collected using apis and displayed using graphs and maps.
